- Greetings. I'm Davi, an aspiring data scientist.
- I love studying how data works, statistics, math (I'm not very good at it) and artificial intelligence.
- I've just started studying databases; SQL, MySQL and R languages; the Pandas and Seaborn frameworks; and data visualization softwares lique Excel, tableau and PowerBI.
- I don't feel ready to colaborate in any project on GitHub yet. Even thought I love technology, I need to learn a lot.
